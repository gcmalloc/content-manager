# EBU Content Manager


The Content Manager is a visual production tool which is able to generate on the fly 
visualisation for DAB slideshow and RadioVIS. 
.NET framework based, it is developped in C# and is distributed under LGPL licence.

The Content Manager can run in a standalone fashion or in an advanced DataGateway environment
allowing external data providers such as Swisstiming to provide valuable data to generate
slideshows for live sports events.
